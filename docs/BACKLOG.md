## High Priority
- Define command interface contract
- Unified output formatter (text/json)
- Error model (exit codes)

## Medium Priority
- Filter DSL (where conditions)
- Recursive FS walkers
- Deterministic ordering

## Low Priority / Nice to Have
- Plugin system
- WASM build
- Embedded mode for other tools
